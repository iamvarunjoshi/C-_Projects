# C-_Projects

This folder contains simple games made using c++, which are made for the purpose of learning various concepts like OOPs and many more concepts and get hands on experience in c++.

Currently Iâ€™ve uploaded two games:
1.) Classic Snake Game which helped to getting started with making projects in c++.
2.) Second game is Cross the Road game in which character has to cross road which is multilane and full of cars. The cars are moving in a random motion and change their direction in between the game making it even more interesting. This helped me to practice various concepts of OOP's and helped me to brush up my skills.
3.) Sudoku Solver: Soon i will put on sudoku solver and Tic-Tac Toe Game also
